    "content": "This book came at a good time. The past year I've been trying to savor the moments and be present, especially since it would be my last year as a university student. What this led to was a feeling of anemoia. Anemoia is recognizing that you are in the moment, and feeling a sense of longing or nostalgia for the now. Seneca helped me recognize that this was not enjoying the moment. \"Even their pleasures are uneasy and made anxious by various fears, and at the very height of their rejoicing the worrying thought steals over them: 'How long will this last?'\" He also made it painfully clear that I must tread carefully so as to not engulf myself completely with work. That I worked anxiously and hard in high school and anxiously and hard still in university just to work further anxiously and harder yet as an employee is the burning of my short life. \"So it is inevitable that life will be not just very short but very miserable for those who acquire by great toil what they must keep by greater toil.\""

    "content": "This is the best classic I’ve read in a while. There are two reasons for this. First, as much as I hold a high nose towards romantic dramas, they are my guilty pleasure. Secondly, Hardy sets scenes that urge you to stop and stare. It’s around this time, solidified by Hardy’s writing, that I’d come to the conclusion I need to take notes in the books I read. If not to simply find examples of his expert prose. One excerpt I enjoyed went, “It was a hazy sunrise in August. The denser nocturnal vapours attacked by the warm beams, were dividing and shrinking into isolated fleeces within hollows and coverts, where they waited till they should be dried away to nothing.”"

    "content": "Mark Musa thoroughly translates this Italian poem for the interested reader. I was not an interested reader. Dante is constantly and obnoxiously referencing Italian historical figures and absolute nobodies. Basically, anyone and everyone who lived in his era. Reading Mark Musa's notes was predominantly to shed light on the random names often thrown around. What especially dated the work was how knowledge of these figures was interlinked with the understanding of the poetry itself. It frustrated me when I caught the underlying symbolism and poetry because its effects were tarnished as I incessantly referred to a Wikipedia of notes suffixing each canto (a canto is a section of a long poem). I am glad the context was there (all thanks to you Mr. Musa), but near the end of the book I just skipped past unknown, uninteresting characters cameoing as Hell's prisoners. This is likely a reality of all older works. They are a product of their time and only certain aspects are truly timeless. According to me, Shakespeare is similarly at fault and yet we regard him as genius. I will say I always looked forward to learning about the next circle of Hell and how Dante would choose to visualize it. That interest spurred me on to the end of the book. As an aside from the critique of the book, why is Euclid stuck in endless nothingness at the outermost layer of Hell? All the while, people who decided, at the end of their lives, to finally repent for their many sins eventually go to Heaven?"

Worse still, they are at liberty to introduce any plot-recorrecting gimmick 400 pages in. Time travel and multiverses are the worst culprits of this.\n\nStill, I gave Dune a chance. If nothing but to be able to watch the recent movies that came out. I was pleasantly surprised with an interesting plot I did not feel cheated by and an arabesque world that was pretty cool. In some sense I felt the author's interpretation of Arabic themes was overly stereotypical, but it did a better job than I was expecting. If you love science fiction this is likely an amazing book for you. In all honesty, for me it wasn’t much.",

    "content": "In the Winter of 2024, I took a computer graphics course. What made this course magical for a computer science student was that the topics weren’t only computer science.To talk about drawing 3D objects on a 2D screen one needs a combination of mathematics, physics, the arts, and of course, computer science. Some days we learned about Pixar animations and perspective and others quadruple integrals. The course was so vast one couldn’t cover all the topics deep enough. So when we got on the topic of ray tracing, the computer simulation of how light rays bounce around in the world, my professor mentioned that all our calculations are done at a macro-level. We try to simulate light rays close enough to reality so it looks believable on the screen. To actually simulate light rays perfectly one would need to study quantum electrodynamics. And he footnotes this book.\n\nWhile small, this book is dense and not an easy read. It covers how strangely particles behave at the atomic level, often against common sense. I would recommend you first read a book like Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time to acclimate. Quantum theory is talked about there too, but it’s much easier to digest. At the end of the day this book gets really close to being a textbook. I could only recommend it to the very interested reader.",

The novel's unfiltered portrayal of poverty hits hard, but some may find the characters bordering on stereotypes and the plot a bit too straightforward.

At times, the Arabs looked like cavemen when they first caught ear of the radio brought from the outside world. Other times, the Americans were insufferable as they struggled to adapt to the climate of the Middle East and as the courteous culture of the Wadi's inhabitants was taken for granted."

Newport supposes the higher echelons of career competence offer flexibility and agency in day-to-day work, which is what makes it enjoyable. While I don't think his arguments are bulletproof, I really like the thesis for the selfish reason that it provides more comfort to me than the alternative. As I delved into the field of computer science, I found having a depth of knowledge to be extremely rewarding and it gave new light to the field as a whole. Getting more expertise in my field made CS more compelling. Computer science is not my only interest, I love mountain biking. Should I make a career out of it? People who say, \"follow your passion\" might tell me to. Newport says, \"probably not.\""

There is a heavy amount of philosophy and how it connects to physics and science as a whole. Somehow, however, with all the detail this book delves into, I found myself walking away with little value."

It’s stark and austere. Maybe it’s because the collection was originally meant to be spoken as opposed to read? I really enjoyed this divergence to what I previously didn't recognize as poetry. There was a section where he describes waiting at the Windsor bus and (begrudgingly) he forces you into that desolate scene with him. \"where do the souls of children go?\" was the most memorable piece to me. Maybe because of how flowery he got with it. I’ll leave you with it’s ending line: \"I was convinced that the strawberry juice staining red my tiny pink fingers was the blood of those below, and that the tiny berries I consumed contained the reincarnations of their little lost souls.\""

A minute examination of the biblical lives of a family, stretching multiple generations over the course of the novel, the house of the Buendia's perpetually rises and falls over each passing tide. You watch as they establish the town of Macondo, as the gypsies discover it, as it's occupied by the army, as the train finally reaches town, as it gets rebuilt after years of endless rain. The time passed in the story is far lengthier than its own pages. I really only have one complaint. The book reminded me of Russian literature in that each character had the same name. At one point there were 18 Aureliano's who WEREN'T main characters. There was even a family tree prefacing the copy I own to help me keep track of who is who. Still easier than The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky."

An all too aware narrator describes the sensitivity of which these characters ballet between their real emotion. This book really feels like a transcript as the narrator breaks the 4th wall repeatedly to bash himself for his bad writing.

They struggle to eat as his large plot of land is not used to grow cotton. No sir, all he does is dig for gold. He's got the 'gold fever'. He's had it for fifteen years. This story is a depiction of the hardships of that time and what it means to have faith.* Quite unique relative to the rest of books I've read in this place and time, this book doesn't focus so much on the injustice of skin color, as it does the realities of living.\n* Actually, here is an amendment after writing this review, I believe Caldwell talks about the futility of faith. God's Little Acre is a plot on Ty Ty's land where any profit made is donated to the church. Everytime they decide to dig on God's Little Acre for gold, Ty Ty moves it. He moves it anytime at will. Never does this acre benefit him other than convincing himself (Ty Ty) that he remembers God. This land consistently has no effect on the story, neither the wins nor losses."

Steinbeck finds a way to distill the essence of his messages into a concise binding without stripping away the enjoyment of the book. As a result, the climactic moments hit.

Up until the latter half of the book I was under the assumption that, like all his previous work, these were all fictional stories. The Yakult Swallows Poetry Collection was not.

Here is a particularly well crafter excerpt from the book: “Muffled musketry sounded again, followed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than those which had preceded it; a kind of throaty, nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic value.”"

At the very least this book ignited my fire to get some work done. The final act is where I have the most problems. I read. And then I skimmed. And then I skipped over most of the 3rd act. He spends the entire time talking about how heavenly angels like the muses from Greek mythology are responsible for the strokes of genius of all humans. He even recites the opening musing to Homer's The Oddysey before starting his work. This, I found completely useless and was not something I cared about. Inspiration is a miraculous thing, but his attempts at rationalizing it were unncessary. Its a short read, but for the self help genre, its one of the best. Although, that does not say much."

In a very Japanese author-like way, there is a lot of supernatural surrealism used to convey meaning. Unlike other authors I have read, however, this felt cliche and got boring after a few stories. Kawaguchi has 2 more books with covers that look very similar to this (with a slight color change). I picked up the first one of those books and found that, yes, yet again it's the same overarching story but with a new set of characters using this magic coffee house. I didn't even try to read them. This could have been better had it been shorter, it overstayed its welcome for sure.",

Shaw writes about a poor flower girl who gets taught how to speak politely by an upper class Englishman. Basically taking her from rags to riches. There's a lot of interesting socio-economic ideas that are brought up because of this. It's not strictly better to live in high society, for example. It's also supposed to be a romantic comedy, which the humour just flew over my head if I'm being honest. It's a play so it's likely a combination of me reading a 2-dimensional script and how old the book is. George was very economical with what got script time and what didn't. He didn't even go into detail as to how he trains her to speak proper English. I haven't read any other George Bernard Shaw books but I definitely will because of this play."

I'd definitely read enough coming of age books so that this just melted in with the rest. As for the depiction of African-American racism in the US, well just read Uncle Tom's Cabin or 12 Years a Slave instead. Those were far more effective in teaching me about the tragedy of slavery in the USA. It's hard for me to say this because if I read this book a couple years prior, it definitely would've been one of my favorites."

Am I going to turn the page and be jolted out of my seat with the big, bold letters “BOO!”?\n\nNonetheless, I gave this collection of short stories a try. The experience moved the macabre from two to three dimensions. I discovered an entirely new flavor of horror.\n\nThe concept of God is, quite honestly, the best connection I can draw up. I know, oxymoronic, but stay with me. The type of cosmic entities lurking behind the pages are oftentimes so great that to name them is taboo, and gazing upon their figure drives one to madness. They are monsters so far beyond human comprehension that most of the horror is left to readers' imagination. In the same way that God is unintelligibly powerful, so too are Cthulhu and Nyarlathotep. Part of the interest is in the verbosity of H.P. Lovecraft. He describes non-Euclidean spaces, otherworldly deities, and grotesque vistas. His use of esoteric vocabulary helps keep readers like me feeling estranged.\n\nWhat’s also great is that the fear doesn’t end when you put the book down. Lovecraft leaves you steeped in wonder as to what might really be out there far longer than most horror I’ve seen.\n\nWhether or not you care for the horror genre, this is a must read. This is a collection of works that has inspired the genre to this day and continues to be talked about. This is a classic."

There isn’t much else to say here, so I’ll tell you about the part that left the largest impact on me. Hawking describes the double-slit experiment, a simple procedure where light is shone onto a paper with two spaced slits and a wall behind it. He concludes the chapter at the climactic realization that a light particle must exist in two different places at the same time for the experiment to make any sense. This stunningly simple experiment, followed by the reasoning to reach this inherently obtuse idea, left me speechless. Well not really, I wasn’t reading out loud or anything. You get it."

It reminded me of horror movies that are composed entirely of jumpscares. Nothing substance, just a facade of fear built upon our surface level human instincts to jump at the sudden crash or clamor. Oh and recycling content is a theme, the authors had a lust for describing characters by naming every designer brand. The first time it was done, when we learned the 50+ different lotions Patrick Batemen puts on every morning, it was a unique way to show the reader just how wealthy he was.

That being said, Trevor is a sole proprietor in the good biography writing scene, from the small selection of biographies I've read. His life is tragic and emotional, but also vibrant and hopeful.

The way of life for North Koreans living in famine is deeply interesting. And sad. Although I find it difficult to empathize with her (as I do with most biographies). Not many can, I think. Her experiences are too outlandish for those of us enjoying modern civilization to be able to comprehend. When both her parents were forced to leave her and her sister behind in their hometown, accounts of her spending the days finding flowers and insects to eat was especially harsh.

I readily sacrifice my sleep for my entertainment. Part of me believes that the extra time is just that, extra time. Mathew Walker says otherwise. He fills the pages with interesting knowledge on the reasons we sleep, how it works, and the cost of not getting enough of it. The reality behind sleep deprivation is severe enough to jolt me back into getting a full night's rest. I started being actively interested in getting the right amount of sleep, at the right times of day, consistently. This book is probably important to read at least once a year. I say probably because I have only read it once, and now that it's been a couple of months I can see my poor sleeping habits beginning to resurface. This is no textbook, Mathew's writing is clear but interesting. You won't be reading a textbook here."
